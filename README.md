# hf
my silly little hf code


## Synopsys

The plan here is to write a "pilot" code that will perform RHF calculation for
water and ethane. 

For the math, I indend to use libcint and OpenBLAS.

To check my work, I am going to look at the exellent programming tutorial (the
from_tutorial dir)

## Goals for rn

- [ ] compute integrals with libcint, compare them to the onces from the tutorial
